        <h1>Kernel</h1>
        <p>A kernel is the essential foundation of a computer's operating system (OS). It's the core that provides basic services for all other parts of the OS. It's the main layer between the OS and underlying computer hardware, and it helps with tasks such as process and memory management, inter-process communication, file system management, device control and networking.</p>
            <h3>Types of Kernels 
            There are five types of kernels:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A Microkernel, which only contains basic functionality</li>
                <li>A Monolithic Kernel, which contains many device drivers</li>
                <li>Hybrid Kernel</li>
                <li>Exokernel</li>
                <li>Nanokernel</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>UNIX Kernel</h1>
            <p>All Unix kernels are reentrant. This means that several processes may be executing in Kernel Mode at the same time. <br> 
                Of course, on uniprocessor systems, only one process can progress, but many can be blocked in Kernel Mode <br>when waiting for the CPU or the completion of some I/O operation. <br> 
                For instance, after issuing a read to a disk <br>on behalf of some process, the kernel lets the disk controller handle it, and resumes executing other processes. <br> 
                An interrupt notifies the kernel when the device has satisfied the read, so the former process can resume the execution.</p>
